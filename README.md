An Off-policy Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Optimal Tracking Control Problem

In this project, the optimal tracking control problem for the quadrotor which is a highly coupling system with completely unknown dynamics is addressed based on data by introducing the
reinforcement learning (RL) technique. The proposed Off-policy RL algorithm does not need any
knowledge of the quadrotor model. By collecting data, which is the states of the quadrotor system then
using an actor-critic network (NNs) to solve the optimal tracking trajectory problem. Finally,
simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
